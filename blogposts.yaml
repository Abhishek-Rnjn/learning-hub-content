- title: An Introduction to Text Style Transfer
  description: Today’s world of natural language processing (NLP) is driven by powerful transformer-based models that can automatically caption images, answer open-ended questions, engage in free dialog, and summarize long-form bodies of text – of course, with varying degrees of success. Success here is typically measured by the accuracy (Did the model produce a correct response?) and fluency (Is the output coherent in the native language?) of the generated text. While these two measures of success are of top priority, they neglect a fundamental aspect of language – style.

- title: One Line Away from your Data
  description: Data Science tools, algorithms, and practices are rapidly evolving to solve business problems on an unprecedented scale. This makes data science one of the most exciting fields to be in. As exciting as it is, practitioners face their fair share of challenges. There are well-known barriers that slow down predictive modeling or application development. Finding the right data and getting access to it are two of the top pain points we hear from our customers.

- title: The Most Unique Snowflake
  description: Okay, I admit, the title is a little click-baity, but it does hold some truth! I spent the holidays up in the mountains, and if you live in the northern hemisphere like me, you know that means that I spent the holidays either celebrating or cursing the snow. When I was a kid, during this time of year we would always do an art project making snowflakes. We would bust out the scissors, glue, paper, string, and glitter, and go to work. At some point, the teacher would undoubtedly pull out the big guns and blow our minds with the fact that every snowflake in the entire world for all of time is different and unique (people just love to oversell unimpressive snowflake features).

- title: Why and How Convolutions Work for Video Classification
  description:
    Video classification is perhaps the simplest and most fundamental of
    the tasks in the field of video understanding. In this blog post, we’ll take a
    deep dive into why and how convolutions work for video classification. Our goal
    is to help the reader develop an intuition about the relationship between space
    (the image part of video) and time (the sequence part of video), and pave the
    way to a deep understanding of video classification algorithms.

  description:
    Video footage constitutes a significant portion of all data in the
    world. The 30 thousand hours of video uploaded to YouTube every hour is a part
    of that data; another portion is produced by 770 million surveillance cameras
    globally.  In addition to being plentiful, video data has tremendous capacity
    to store useful information. Its vastness, richness, and applicability make the
    understanding of video a key activity within the field of computer vision.

    "Make Your Models Matter: What It Takes to Maximize Business Value from Your
    Machine Learning Initiatives"
  description:
    We are excited by the endless possibilities of machine learning (ML).
    We recognise that experimentation is an important component of any enterprise
    machine learning practice. But, we also know that experimentation alone doesn’t
    yield business value. Organizations need to usher their ML models out of the lab
    (i.e., the proof-of-concept phase) and into deployment, which is otherwise known
    as being “in production”

  description:
    It’s no secret that Data Scientists have a difficult job. It feels
    like a lifetime ago that everyone was talking about data science as the sexiest
    job of the 21st century. Heck, it was so long ago that people were still meeting
    in person! Today, the sexy is starting to lose its shine. There’s recognition
    that it’s nearly impossible to find the unicorn data scientist that was the apple
    of every CEO’s eye in 2012. You know the one, the mathematician / statistician
    / computer scientist / data engineer / industry expert. It turns out it’s hard
    to find all that awesome packed into a single brain.

- title: Switching from CPUs to GPUs for NYC Taxi Fare Predictions with NVIDIA RAPIDS
  description:
    Have you ever asked a data scientist if they wanted their code to run
    faster? You would probably get a more varied response asking if the earth is flat.
    It really isn’t any different from anything else in tech, faster is almost always
    better. One of the best ways to make a substantial improvement in processing time
    is to, if you haven’t already, switched from CPUs to GPUs. Thanks to pioneers
    like Andrew NG and Fei-Fei Li, GPUs have made headlines for performing particularly
    well with deep learning techniques.

- title: Automatic Summarization from TextRank to Transformers
  description:
    To train a machine learning model you generally need to move all the
    data to a single machine or, failing that, to a cluster of machines in a data
    center. This can be difficult for two reasons. First, there can be privacy barriers.
    A smartphone user may not want to share their baby photos with an application
    developer. A user of industrial equipment may not want to share sensor data with
    the manufacturer or a competitor. And healthcare providers are not totally free
    to share their patients’ data with drug companies. Second, there are practical
    engineering challenges. A huge amount of valuable training data is created on
    hardware at the edges of slow and unreliable networks, such as smartphones, IoT
    devices, or equipment in far-flung industrial facilities such as mines and oil
    rigs. Communication with such devices can be slow and expensive. This research
    report and its associated prototype introduce federated learning, an algorithmic
    solution to these problems.

- title: Extractive Summarization with Sentence-BERT
  description:
    In extractive summarization, the task is to identify a subset of text
    (e.g., sentences) from a document that can then be assembled into a summary. Overall,
    we can treat extractive summarization as a recommendation problem. That is, given
    a query, recommend a set of sentences that are relevant. The query here is the
    document, relevance is a measure of whether a given sentence belongs in the document
    summary.

- title: Exploring Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization
  description:
    The machine learning life cycle is more than data + model = API. We
    know there is a wealth of subtlety and finesse involved in data cleaning and feature
    engineering. In the same vein, there is more to model-building than feeding data
    in and reading off a prediction. ML model building requires thoughtfulness both
    in terms of which metric to optimize for a given problem, and how best to optimize
    your model for that metric!
